# SQLAlchemy
- What are ORMs and why are they cool?
Object-relational-mapping is the idea of being able to write queries using the object-oriented paradigm of your preferred programming language. So, ORMs (object relational mappers) are basically libraries that try to implement this functionality in your choice of programming language.
   - why are ORMs cool: 
     - You get to write in the language you are already using anyway.
     - Abstraction : It abstracts away the database system so that switching from MySQL to PostgreSQL for example, becomes easy.
     - Depending on the ORM you get a lot of advanced features such as support for transactions, connection pooling, migrations(schema), seeds, streams, etc
     - Optimization: Many of the queries you write will perform better than if you wrote them yourself.
